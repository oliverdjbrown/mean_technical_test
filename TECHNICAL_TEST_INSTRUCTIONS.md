# devTest
We want to understand better how good you are integrating several technologies to provide a solid solution, this is a sample project that will help ilustrate just that.

**Exchange rate per symbol**

We would like to generate a site that provides exchange information and general information of the sample platform selected to the end users.

**Socket endpoint:** 
wss://ws.bitmex.com/realtime?subscribe=instrument,orderBookL2_25:XBTUSD

For reference: https://www.bitmex.com/app/wsAPI

**WEB API:**
https://www.bitmex.com/api/explorer/#!/Announcement/Announcement_get

3. Present the data in a human readable fashion (ReactJS/Blazor/Etc)
4. Store the records received from the connection into a database SQL Server/MariaDB/MongoDB/Postgres/
5. In a separated section of the solution provide a way to search or filter for the results stored in the Database of choice sorted by date in decending order, maybe you can add any sort of filter here too.


**This test will evaluate:**
1. Web Socket/API consumption capabilities
2. Knowledge of API integration between databases/API
3. Also will show capabilities of handling the frontend technologies
4. Familiarity with the language
